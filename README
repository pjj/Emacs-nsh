Learn to use shells in emacs buffers and there is no going back to terminals!

Emacs-nsh adds amazing features to shells within buffers.  Name your shells,
and it will automatically keep separate histories for each of your named shells.
Get Dropbox, and it will allow you to access all your named-shell histories
from all of your machines.  I've used this tool for years, and it has saved me 
tons of time (it only gets better over time).  With a simple grep in
~/Dropbox/nsh_history/* I can find the arguments for commands that I
issued years ago.


Installation instructions:

Download nsh.el to your ~/Dropbox/elisp/ directory.

Add the following line to your emacs init (or .emacs) file:

(load "~/Dropbox/elisp/nsh.el")

Usage:

Start a new named shell with: M-x nsh (Esc-x nsh).  Enter the shell's 
name in the minibuffer.  You can auto-complete the name using the 
tab key (nsh will look up the names of all your existing histories).
